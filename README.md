# Newsletter-Signup
Newsletter signup is a feature implemented using Node.js, Express.js, Mailchimp API, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It allows users to subscribe to a newsletter by providing their email address. 
The Node.js backend, powered by Express.js, handles the form submission and communicates with the Mailchimp API to store the subscribers' information.
The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code create an appealing and user-friendly signup form, which can be enhanced with Bootstrap for a responsive design. This integration enables seamless data collection and management, ensuring that subscribers receive updates and relevant content through the newsletter service.
